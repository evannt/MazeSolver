# :cyclone: MazeSolver

A Java based maze solver that uses various algorithms to solve mazes and visualize a path! This maze solver can utilize three methods to solves mazes: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Djikstra's algorithm.

In the project you can adjust the following:
* Maze width and height
* Maze density
* Maze weights
* Search Algorithm (BFS, DFS, and Djisktra)
  * Breadth-First Search gaurantees the shortest path
  * Depth-First Search explores the deepest path first
  * Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path based on path cost
* Algorithm speed

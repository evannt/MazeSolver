# MazeSolver

MazeSolver can utilize three methods to solves mazes: Breadth-First Search(BFS), Depth-First Search(DFS), and Djikstra's algorithm.

## Usage

Run the MazeGUI class.

Adjust the following:
* Maze width and height
* Maze density
* Maze weights
* Search Algorithm (BFS, DFS, and Djisktra)
* Algorithm speed
